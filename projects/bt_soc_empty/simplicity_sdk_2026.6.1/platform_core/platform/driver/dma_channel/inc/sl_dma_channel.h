 * @addtogroup dma_channel DMA Channel Driver
 * @brief High-level API to perform DMA transfers on a single channel.
 * @details
 *  ## Overview
 *
 *  The DMA Channel Driver builds on top of the @ref dma_manager service. It
 *  assumes a DMA channel has already been allocated (or reserved) at the
 *  manager layer and focuses on per-channel operations: transfer submission,
 *  queuing and linking, status query, and callback notification.
 *
 *  Together, the DMA Manager and the DMA Channel Driver replace the legacy
 *  @ref dmadrv component. See the
 *  <a href="https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/latest/platform-dmadrv-migration-guide/">
 *  DMADRV Migration Guide</a> for the full API mapping table when porting
 *  existing code.
 *
 *  Core responsibilities:
 *   - Provide simple memory-to-memory (M2M), memory-to-peripheral (M2P) and
 *     peripheral-to-memory (P2M) submission APIs.
 *   - Maintain a software queue (singly-linked list) mirroring the hardware
 *     descriptor link chain so that completions can be processed in batch
 *     when interrupts are delayed or masked.
 *   - Invoke a user callback once per descriptor (or per aborted descriptor
 *     when an error occurs) with explicit error / abort flags.
 *   - Automatically select an optimal transfer unit size (byte/half/word)
 *     based on alignment and length for M2M transfers, and automatically
 *     segment transfers larger than the hardware descriptor capacity.
 *
 *  ## Integration steps
 *
 *  To integrate the DMA Channel Driver in an application:
 *
 *  -# **Add the components.** Include the `dma_channel` and `dma_manager`
 *     SLC components in your `.slcp`. The DMA Manager is auto-initialized by
 *     SL Main; no manual `init()` call is required.
 *  -# **Allocate (or reserve) a channel.** Use
 *     `sl_dma_manager_allocate_channel()` (any channel) or
 *     `sl_dma_manager_reserve_channel()` (a specific channel number) from
 *     the DMA Manager.
 *  -# **Declare and initialize a channel handle.** Each active channel needs
 *     one application-owned `sl_dma_channel_handle_t`. Call
 *     @ref sl_dma_channel_init() with the channel number, the peripheral
 *     instance (or NULL for the default), the completion callback and a
 *     user-data pointer.
 *  -# **Set the peripheral signal if required.** Memory-to-peripheral and
 *     peripheral-to-memory transfers use block-handshake mode by default
 *     and need a request line from the peripheral. Call
 *     @ref sl_dma_channel_set_peripheral_signal() with the appropriate
 *     `SL_DMA_SIGNAL_*` constant before submitting M2P/P2M traffic.
 *     Memory-to-memory transfers do not need this step.
 *  -# **Submit transfers.** Pick the helper that matches your transfer
 *     pattern (see "Transfer modes" below). Pass `NULL` as the descriptor
 *     argument to let the driver allocate one, or pre-allocate via
 *     @ref sl_dma_channel_descriptor_alloc() for deterministic memory use.
 *  -# **Handle completions.** The callback registered at init time is
 *     invoked once per descriptor that requested a callback, with explicit
 *     `error` / `aborted` flags. Application code may also poll progress
 *     via @ref sl_dma_channel_get_status().
 *  -# **Tear down.** When done, call @ref sl_dma_channel_abort() if a
 *     transfer is still active, then @ref sl_dma_channel_deinit() to release
 *     the channel handle and `sl_dma_manager_free_channel()` to return the
 *     channel to the manager.
 *

 *
 *  ## Peripheral signals and block-handshake mode
 *
 *  Peripheral-attached transfers (M2P, P2M, and their ping-pong /
 *  triple-buffered variants) advance one block at a time on a request line
 *  asserted by the peripheral — this is what the API and the underlying
 *  hardware call *block-handshake mode* (see the @p block_handshake_mode
 *  field of @ref sl_dma_channel_transfer_t). The peripheral signal selected
 *  via @ref sl_dma_channel_set_peripheral_signal() identifies that request
 *  line. Without a signal set, an M2P or P2M transfer would have no
 *  hardware event to gate on. M2M transfers use full-cycle mode and ignore
 *  the peripheral signal.
 *
 *  ## Callback contract
 *
 *  The completion callback installed by @ref sl_dma_channel_init() is invoked
 *  from DMA channel IRQ context. It receives the channel handle, the
 *  user-data pointer, and two booleans:
 *
 *   - @p error    — set when the hardware reported a channel error. The
 *                   channel is automatically disabled and the remaining
 *                   queued descriptors are aborted.
 *   - @p aborted  — set when @ref sl_dma_channel_abort() was used to terminate
 *                   the descriptor (or when the descriptor was aborted as a
 *                   side-effect of an error).
 *
 *  Both `false` means a normal completion. In looping modes
 *  (ping-pong / triple-buffered) the callback is invoked on every buffer
 *  completion until the channel is aborted by the application. The callback
 *  return type is `void` — there is no way to stop a looping transfer from
 *  the callback by returning a value; call @ref sl_dma_channel_abort()
 *  instead.
 *
 *  ## Error handling
 *
 *  If the hardware sets the CHERROR bit for a channel, the driver disables
 *  the channel, aborts all queued descriptors and invokes the registered
 *  callback for each pending descriptor with @p error=true and
 *  @p aborted=true. The application is responsible for re-enabling or
 *  reinitializing the channel before submitting new work.
 *
 *  ## Performance
 *
 *  On devices with external FLASH, the component "RAM Code for DMA Channel
 *  Performance" (`ram_code_select_dma_channel_performance`) can be added to
 *  move the DMA channel ISR into RAM to improve interrupt latency at the
 *  cost of higher RAM consumption.
 *
 *  ## Typical usage
 *
 *  The example below shows a memory-to-memory transfer (`app_dma_m2m`,
 *  no peripheral signal needed) and a memory-to-peripheral transfer
 *  (`app_dma_tx`, which calls @ref sl_dma_channel_set_peripheral_signal()
 *  first because m2p uses block-handshake mode).
